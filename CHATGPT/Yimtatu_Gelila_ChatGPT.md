When starting my experimental design, I came up with a combination of different kinds of prompts and compiled it all in a list:  <br>
*   Open ended, direct, and casual  
*   Direct, high complexity, formal  
*   Indirect, low-complexity, formal  
*   Casual, direct, closed-ended <br>

My plan before getting onto ChatGPT was to make sure I had a continuous conversation, but the content of each question I asked always had different subject. For example: take the first couple of questions I asked: <br>

As you can see, the first question was direct and very casual (as indicated by the ‘Hey’ at the start); it allowed ChatGPT freedom to answer but it was to-the-point. Then, I started to turn the conversation to something a bit more serious, also direct but now high complexity. I thought this was interesting because ChatGPT was still talking to me in a more casual tone tone! So I continued with the formal tone in hopes that ChatGPT would adjust:    <br>

So yes, ChatGPT’s response did adjust. Not only did they give me a formal response again, but also they gave me a direct response as well. So, to change it up, I asked a simple yes or no question to throw ChatGPT off:  <br>

This was a closed-ended and casual question. I expected a short answer, yes or no, so I was surprised when ChatGPT gave me a longer answer. I was not surprised though when ChatGPT answered in exclamation! Casual!<br>

I think it is really interesting to see how this AI system is adjusting to 
Lastly, I was done with ChatGPT, so I wanted to end the conversation abruptly. This was closed-ended and direct, but I made it formal because I was curious to see how ChatGPT reacted. This was the most telling response. It was a reminder that ChatGPT is not perfect, and most of all, not human. It is catering to whatever the user wants, and we are working towards making technology as adaptable as possible. Nonetheless, it was very impressive to properly analyze what ChatGPT is doing. <br>
