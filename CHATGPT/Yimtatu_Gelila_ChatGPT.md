When starting my experimental design, I came up with a combination of different kinds of prompts. My strategy involved transitioning from casual and open-ended inquiries to more formal and complex questions, as well as closed-ended queries to observe ChatGPT's adaptability. To plan out what I wanted to, I have compiled it all in a list:  <br>
*   Open ended, direct, and casual  
*   Direct, high complexity, formal  
*   Indirect, low-complexity, formal  
*   Casual, direct, closed-ended <br>
*   Formal, open-ended, indirect <br>

My plan before getting onto ChatGPT was to make sure I had a continuous conversation, but the content of each question I asked always had different subject. For example: take the first couple of questions I asked: <br>

As you can see, the first question was direct and very casual (as indicated by the ‘Hey’ at the start). It served as a relaxed icebreaker, allowing ChatGPT to respond informally while setting a conversational tone. The format of the question was to-the-point. Then, I started to turn the conversation to something a bit more serious, also direct but now high complexity. I thought this was interesting because ChatGPT was still talking to me in a more casual tone tone! So I continued with the formal tone in hopes that ChatGPT would adjust:    <br>

So yes, ChatGPT’s response did adjust. Not only did they give me a formal response again, but also they gave me a direct response as well. So, to change it up, I asked a simple yes or no question to throw ChatGPT off:  <br>

To further test ChatGPT's adaptability, I posed a closed-ended question. I expected a short answer, yes or no, so I was surprised when ChatGPT gave me a longer answer. I was not surprised though when ChatGPT answered in exclamation! Casual, but a lengthy answer nonetheless! It suggests ChatGPT's ability to grasp context and provide nuanced answers, even to closed questions. <br>

I wanted to end the conversation abruptly. This was closed-ended and direct, but I made it formal because I was curious to see how ChatGPT reacted. This was the most telling response. It was a reminder that ChatGPT is not perfect, and most of all, not human. It is catering to whatever the user wants, and we are working towards making technology as adaptable as possible. Nonetheless, it was very impressive to properly analyze what ChatGPT is doing. <br>
